Hi, I'm Benji!

I am a game developer working at [GoldFire Studios](https://goldfirestudios.com/).

In my free time, I make small games, toys and music tools that you can find on [itch.io](http://okaybenji.itch.io).

The code for these is open source and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/okaybenji).

I also compose music for video games, [commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuV3tPCMqQ8) and short films. You can hear some of that on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/dreamreader).

I've released a couple of pop albums which you can listen to on [Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/love-is-a-story/297091910) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1v7X8OOq36L336loqShoL7).

I've produced a few JavaScript tutorials for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVz-Bml3D7HleF0sAgyUMbQ), and sometimes I write about JavaScript on [Medium](https://medium.com/@okaybenji).

I also recently started a progressive political channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLxPaKQG-O4GNTbuJoqbxYQ).

If you want, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/okaybenji), where sometimes I post art. I also post colorful photos to [Instagram](http://instagram.com/okaybenji/).

Oh, and I have a profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/okaybenji/).
